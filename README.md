# CineNavigator

Welcome to the CineNavigator repository, a content-based movie recommendation system designed to suggest movies based on attributes like genres, directors, actors, and plot summaries. Trained on a dataset of over 5000 movies, this system generates personalized recommendations for users.

## Overview

This project implements a movie recommender system using content-based filtering and natural language processing techniques. By analyzing movie plots, genres, and casts, it suggests movies similar to the ones users like, providing personalized recommendations.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical computations and data arrays.
- **scikit-learn**: Provides machine learning algorithms and utilities for model building and evaluation.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for text preprocessing and tokenization.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web applications.

## Dataset

- **Source**: The movie dataset used in this project is sourced from the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset.
