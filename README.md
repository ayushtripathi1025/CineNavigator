# CineNavigator
Welcome to the Content-Based Movie Recommendation System repository. This project uses content-based filtering to suggest movies based on attributes like genres, directors, actors, and plot summaries. Trained on a dataset of 5000+ movies, it generates personalized recommendations for users.

# Movie Recommender System
This project implements a movie recommender system using content-based filtering and natural language processing techniques. The system suggests movies similar to the ones users like, based on movie plots, genres, and casts.
